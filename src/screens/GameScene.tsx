/**
 * Game screen: renders the static 3D board in a daylight diorama scene.
 *
 * Lighting:
 * - hemisphereLight: soft sky/ground fill (sky #cbe8f5, ground #8a9a5b) at
 *   low intensity 0.35 — keeps unlit sides warm and grounded without washing
 *   out the directional shadow.
 * - ambientLight: trimmed to 0.4 (was 0.5) since the HDRI Environment now adds
 *   image-based fill light — keeps the scene from over-brightening while the
 *   directional shadow still reads clearly against the hemisphere fill.
 * - directionalLight: unchanged — position, intensity, shadow map.
 * - SoftShadows: drei helper (PCF soft shadows, no extra assets) with modest
 *   size/samples so shadow edges are feathered without tanking perf.
 * - CameraRig: drei OrbitControls tuned for tabletop overhead view + gentle
 *   auto-focus toward the active player's tile each turn.
 * - Environment (HDRI): loads /images/sky.webp — a 2048x1024 equirectangular
 *   sky map — for real image-based lighting/reflections AND (when
 *   SHOW_HDRI_BACKGROUND) as the visible sky background. Replaces the earlier
 *   procedural Lightformer IBL. drei's Environment loads the equirect .webp via
 *   its texture path (no RGBELoader needed for LDR images) and suspends while
 *   loading, so it lives inside a Suspense boundary.

/**
 * HDRI tunables.
 * - ENV_INTENSITY: strength of the image-based lighting/reflections the sky
 *   contributes. Kept modest so the directional key light still dominates and
 *   Bloom doesn't blow out.
 * - BG_INTENSITY: brightness of the visible HDRI sky background.
 * - SHOW_HDRI_BACKGROUND: when true, the HDRI sky is rendered as the scene
 *   background (replacing the flat #cbe8f5 color). When false, the Environment
